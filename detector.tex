To be able to reliably probe the energy scales at which the \SM breaks
down, one of the largest machines ever built was constructed in a
27~km ring underground on the border of France and Switzerland: the
\LHC. Along this are built a series of detectors that can record in a high
level of detail the result of high energy particle collisions produced
by this collider. This chapter will focus on the details and
performance of \CMS, a multi-purpose detector optimised to search for
new, as yet undiscovered, particles.

\section{The \LHC}
\label{sec:lhc}

The \LHC is a hadron collider designed to collide protons and lead
ions at centre of mass energies up to 14\tev, the highest ever achieved by such a
machine
\cite{Evans:2008zzb,CERN-2004-003-V-1,CERN-2004-003-V-2,CERN-2004-003-V-3}.
The proton-proton collisions are most utilised for direct searches for
new physics and therefore take up the vast majority of the \LHC's
running time. 

To bring protons up to the $6.5\tev$ required in Run~2 of the \LHC they are
accelerated through a series of stages. Hydrogen atoms are initially stripped
of their electrons and accelerated to 50\mev by a linear accelerator,
\ac{LINAC2}. The energy is then increased to 1.4\gev by the \ac{PSB} before
being injected into the \ac{PS} which brings the energies up to 26\gev. A final
kick up to 450\gev is provided by the \ac{SPS}. This chain of accelerators also
collect the protons into bunches that are either 25~ns (from Run~2 onwards) or
50~ns apart (during Run~1 and early stages of Run~2). These bunches are then
injected into the \LHC, in which they are steered by around 1200
superconducting dipole magnets while being accelerated up to $6.5\tev$ with
\ac{RF} cavities. Once the beam has reached the intended energy and is stable,
protons are collided at four different points on the ring, around which are
built the four major \LHC detectors, ALICE \cite{Aamodt:2008zz}, ATLAS
\cite{Aad:2008zzm}, LHCb \cite{Alves:2008zz} and \CMS \cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa}.
A representation of this accelerator complex and the location of the
detectors can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhc}.

\end{figure}

As well as attaining record breaking energies, the \LHC is designed to
collide hadrons at a very high luminosity, with a bunch collision rate
up to $40\mhz$ \cite{Evans:2008zzb}. The necessity of this is demonstrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:xsecs}. The rate at which electroweak scale processes
occur in proton collisions is significantly lower than their
associated backgrounds. The \LHC is therefore designed to run at a
maximum instantaneous luminosity of $10^{34}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ to
maximise the occurence of rare high energy processes. Along with
the high collision rate, this luminosity is achieved by squeezing the
proton bunches to increase the number of simultaneous collisions per
bunch crossing, the extra simultaneous collisions are known as \PU.
The \LHC has typically operated with a \PU of $\sim10\xdash20$,
however to increase the luminosity in the future this value will be
increased up to a \PU of O(100). This presents a significant challenge
for future the future of physics analyses at the \LHC.

\end{figure}

During Run~1 of the \LHC, from 2010-2013, a total of $23.3\ifb$ of
data were collected at energies of $\sqrt{s}=7\tev$ and $8\tev$. After
this there was a period of shutdown in which the \LHC and the
detectors underwent a series of upgrades. Run~2 then began in 2015
with the collision of protons at $\sqrt{s}=13\tev$. During 2015 a
total of $4.3\ifb$ were collected at this energy. So far in 2016 the
\LHC has delivered $34.6\ifb$, a record breaking number of collisions
at the highest ever recorded energies. 

\section{The \CMS detector} \label{sec:cms}

The \CMS detector is one of two multipurpose
detectors built around proton beam collision points and,
situated at Point 5 on the \LHC. The key goals of the CMS detector at
its conception were the discovery of the \SM Higgs boson and search
for signatures of \BSM physics. In \CMS the results of collisions are
measured with a series of subdetectors, built within and around a 3.8T
superconducting solenoid, designed to track, identify and record the
energy of all non-neutrino SM particles \cite{Bayatian:2006zz}. With
its comprehensive, close to $4\pi$, solid angle coverage, \CMS is well
suited to inferring the existence of weakly interacting particles
through the momentum imbalance of visible particles.

highlighting the key detecting components \cite{Bayatian:2006zz}}
\label{fig:CMS} \end{figure}

A representative view of \CMS and its components can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CMS}. The detector is designed in a series of
cylindrical layers of subdetectors working out from the centre, where
the proton collisions occur. The first layer consists of the silicon
tracking system. This tracker is designed to allow the reconstruction
of the trajectory of charged particles as they move through the
magnetic field. The degree to which the path of these particles is
bent allows for an accurate determination of their momentum. The next
layer beyond the silicon tracker is the \ECAL.

\subsection{The Inner Tracking System} Within the superconducting
solenoid is the silicon tracking system that can track
\mbox{$p_T>1$~GeV} charged particles with an efficiency greater than
$99\%$ \cite{Bayatian:2006zz}.
The Pixel Detector is the high granularity component of the tracking
system that sits closest to the interaction point, covering the
pseudorapidity region $|\eta|<2.1$ \footnote{$\eta \equiv
-ln[tan\frac{\theta}{2}]$, where $\theta$ is measured with respect to
the z-axis that points along the beam direction.}. The Silicon Strip
Tracker sits around this with barrel and endcap components covering
$|\eta|<2.4$. By measuring the curvature of their tracks, charged
particle momenta can be measured with an error between $1.5\%$ and
$3\%$ for $p_T\sim 100$ GeV \cite{Adam_Elwood_MSci}. The resolution of
the trackers is such that the points of origin of event decay products
can be inferred within $10$~$\mu$m, allowing the performance of CMS to
extend up to very high pileup (number of simultaneous collisions)
\cite{CMSTrackPerformance}.

\subsection{The Electromagnetic and Hadronic Calorimeters} Surrounding
the tracking system are the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters
(ECAL and HCAL). The ECAL is constructed from 75~848 PbWO$_4$
scintillating crystals covering $|\eta|<3$. They are designed to
absorb electrons and photons and emit light proportional to the energy
deposited. This light is detected by custom photodiodes designed to
perform well in high magnetic fields.  \\\\ The HCAL is designed to
absorb hadrons and is constructed from brass absorbers interleaved
with scintillating plastic tiles covering $|\eta|<3$. The
scintillations are read out with hybrid photodiodes via wavelength
shifting fibres.  \\\\ In the forward detector regions, the hadronic
calorimetry is extended up to $|\eta|<5$ with the Forward Calorimeter,
made from steel absorber with quartz scintillating fibre. To also help
prevent signal contamination from low energy neutral pions there is a
Preshower detector consisting of lead absorbers and silicon
microstrips \cite{CMSTechDesign1DetectorPerformance}\cite{Cutajar}.

\subsection{The Muon System} As muons are unlikely to be absorbed in
the ECAL and HCAL, a muon system is built into the iron return yoke
that surrounds the solenoid.  This consists of wire chambers
containing ionising gas that allows the measurement of muon momenta
with a greater than $1\%$ precision
\cite{CMS_Overview_Chatrchyan:2008aa}.

\subsection{The Trigger and Data Acquisition System}
\label{sec:triggers} The rate of collisions at the LHC is so high that
it would be impossible to reconstruct and store the results of all
collision events. As the majority of the collisions are soft QCD
processes, they are not useful in the search for new physics at the
electroweak energy scale. This necessitates a multi-level trigger
system that is designed to pick out and store only high centre-of-mass
physics processes. The Level 1 Trigger (L1T) is the first component of
the trigger system and is made from custom FPGA computational boards
situated close to the detector. This uses coarse information from the
calorimeters and muon system to reduce the event rate from $20$MHz
(during Run 1) to $\sim100$kHz. The data from the subdetectors are
then passed to the High Level Trigger (HLT), which uses full detector
information to reconstruct the events and reduce the data rate to
$\sim1$kHz. The remaining events are then fully reconstructed and
stored at various Grid sites \cite{GridTechDesign}.
