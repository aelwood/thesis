%% Preface
% \begin{preface}
%   This thesis describes my research on various aspects of the \LHCb
%   particle physics program, centred around the \LHCb detector and \LHC
%   accelerator at \CERN in Geneva.
%
%   \noindent
%   For this example, I'll just mention \ChapterRef{chap:SomeStuff}
%   and \ChapterRef{chap:MoreStuff}.

\frontquote{Traditional scientific method has always been, at the
very best, 20-20 hindsight. It's good for seeing where you've been.
It's good for testing the truth of what you think you know, but it
can't tell you where you ought to go.}%

%Come, let us hasten to a higher plane,\\
%Where dyads tread the fairy fields of Venn,\\
%Their indices bedecked from one to n,\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%Commingled in an endless Markov chain!\\
%Come, every frustum longs to be a cone,\\
%And every vector dreams of matrices.\\
%Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%It whispers of a more ergodic zone.\\
%In Riemann, Hilbert, or in Banach space\\
%Let superscripts and subscripts go their ways.\\
%Our asymptotes no longer out of phase,\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%We shall encounter, counting, face to face.\\
%I'll grant thee random access to my heart,\\
%Thou'lt tell me all the constants of thy love;\\
%And so we two shall all love's lemmas prove,\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%And in our bound partition never part.\\
%For what did Cauchy know, or Christoffel,\\
%Or Fourier, or any Boole or Euler,\\
%Wielding their compasses, their pens and rulers,\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%Of thy supernal sinusoidal spell?\\
%Cancel me not -- for what then shall remain?\\
%Abscissas, some mantissas, modules, modes,\\
%A root or two, a torus and a node:\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%The inverse of my verse, a null domain.\\
%Ellipse of bliss, converge, O lips divine!\\
%The product of our scalars is defined!\\
%Cyberiad draws nigh, and the skew mind\\
%\vspace{0.2cm}
%Cuts capers like a happy haversine.\\
%I see the eigenvalue in thine eye,\\
%I hear the tender tensor in thy sigh.\\
%Bernoulli would have been content to die,\\
%Had he but known such $a^2 cos(2\phi)$.
