  An inclusive search for supersymmetry with jets and missing
  transverse energy is presented. Data from $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$
  $pp$-collisions with a total integrated luminosity of $12.9~\ifb$
  delivered by the LHC and collected by the CMS detector are analysed.
  The dominant quantum chromodynamic multijet background is strongly suppressed with several
  kinematic variables, which are also used to discriminate between
  standard model and supersymmetric processes. The observed events are
  found to be compatible with the expected contributions from standard
  model processes. This result is interpreted in the context of
  simplified supersymmetric models of gluino and third-generation
  squark production. The mass of the gluino, bottom squark and top squark
  are excluded to 1775, 1025 and 875~\gev respectively.

  In preparation for the collection of $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ data by CMS,
  the jet algorithm for the Level-1 trigger is upgraded. The new
  algorithm allows for dynamic pileup subtraction and takes advantage
  of hardware upgrades to the trigger. The performance of variations
  of pileup subtraction for upgrade algorithm are evaluated and the
  most promising algorithm, \emph{chunky-donut subtraction}, is
  chosen. The algorithm is found to give a significant performance
  improvement and has been used to collect data from 2016 onwards.
