\section{Simulated event samples} %day 1

A selection of simulated \MC samples are used to help estimate the \SM
backgrounds and possible signal within the analysis. The samples are
generated with the methods discussed in Sec.~\ref{sec:mc_reco}. The
majority of samples, including the signal model samples, are simulated
with \textsc{MadGraph5} \cite{Alwall:2011uj,Alwall:2014hca} at \LO
accuracy: \QCD multijet samples, Drell-Yan + jets, \wj, \zj and \gj.
Using the same generator at \NLO accuracy, the s-channel single top,
{\ttbar}W and {\ttbar}Z events are simulated. Additionally, the
\textsc{powheg} \cite{Alioli:2010xd,Re:2010bp} generator is used at
\NLO accuracy to describe the t-channel and tW-channel production of
single top quarks. Diboson (WW, WZ, ZZ) production is simulated using
\textsc{pythia} 8.2 \cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}. This generator is also
used to simulate the decays of the sparticles within the signal
models. The cross-sections used for total event yield normalisation
are calculated at \NLO and \NNLO precision
\cite{Alwall:2011uj,Re:2010bp,Alioli:2009je,Gavin:2010az,Melia:2011tj,Czakon:2011xx,Gavin:2012sy}.
The detector response is simulated using \textsc{Geant4}
\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}.

As the simulations cannot fully recreate all the effects within data a
series of corrections are made on the event yields predicted by the
simulation. They are described in the rest of this section.

\subsection{Pileup reweighting}

When the \MC samples are generated the number of \PU collisions are
simulated as Poisson distributed about a particular average. As the
simulation is produced before the data is collected, the actual \PU
distribution cannot be accurately simulated. To correct for this
effect the \MC events are reweighted to ensure their \PU profile
matches that in data. 
%Show PU reweighting plot here?

\subsection{Scale factors}

There are often small differences between the efficiencies of finding
physics objects that is simulated to that which is observed in data.
The difference between these efficiencies is measured using a known
data sample, such as \zmumu events to measure muon efficiencies. A
scale factor is then applied to the \MC to reweight the simulated
events in a way that means they more accurately simulate the
efficiency of finding various physics objects. These scale factors are
typically determined as a function of \pT and \eta, two quantities in
which the detector response can vary significantly. These scale
factors are used to correct lepton, photon and $b$-tagging efficiencies.

\subsection{Top \pT reweighting}% or NISR??

The \ttbar simulation predicts a softer top-quark \pT spectrum than is
observed in data. This is corrected with a scale factor that is
dependent on the \pT of the \ttbar system.

\subsection{Trigger efficiencies}

To account for inefficiencies in the trigger selection when collecting
data, the \MC sample event yields are corrected down. For the muon control
samples the trigger is simulated and the difference between the
measured efficiency in data and simulation is corrected with a
dedicated scale factor. For the \gj control sample the trigger
efficiency is measured in a hadronic event sample and the \MC is
corrected as a function of the photon \pT and \eta. Within the signal
region, the efficiencies are measured as a function of \MHT using
events that pass a reference electron trigger.  As one of the analysis goals
is to maintain low thresholds to \HT and \MHT within the signal
region, the efficiencies are found to be significantly less than 100\%
in certain regions of phase space.

\subsection{Cross-section corrections}

The phase space of events considered within this search are selected
to have a high-\HT and high-\MET. The total number of events predicted
by the \MC samples within this phase space does not agree with that
observed in data. To correct this normalisation correction factors are
derived in \emph{sidebands} after all the other corrections have been
applied.

analysis I'm writing...)

\section{Background estimation for processes with genuine \MET} %day 2

The accurate determination of the \SM backgrounds is of utmost
importance when searching for the indications of \BSM phenomena. So as
not to rely too heavily on the modelling of the backgrounds in
simulation, a \emph{data-driven} approach is utilised wherever
possible. As this analysis is carried out with the requirement of
significant hadronic activity, mismodelling effects are particularly
prevalent due to the difficulties in simulating strong force
interactions to a high degree of accuracy.

Given that the analysis selections are chosen to reduce the \QCD
multijet background to a negligible level, the significant \SM
backgrounds that must be predicted are those with genuine \MET in
their final state. The data-driven method used for predicting these
backgrounds is described in this section.

\subsection{Transfer factor method}

The control samples, defined in Sec.~\ref{sec:controlregions}, are
chosen to provide a collection of events in data that are in a phase
space that is close to that of the signal region. The control samples
are split into $(\HT,\nj,\nb)$ bins in a way that is equivalent to the
signal region, as introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:categorisation}. Each
bin in a control region can then be extrapolated to the signal region
through the use of \emph{\TFs} that are derived from
simulation.  Each \TF is defined as a ratio of the yields
obtained from \MC simulation for the same bin of the signal region and
a given control sample:
\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:tf-ratio}
  {\rm TF} = \frac{N_{\rm MC}^{\rm signal}(\njet,\nb,\scalht)}{N_{\rm
      MC}^{\rm control}(\njet,\nb,\scalht)}, 
\end{equation}
where $N_{\rm MC}^{\rm signal}$ is the total simulated event yield for
all background processes in the signal region and $N_{\rm MC}^{\rm
control}$ is the equivalent event yield in a particular control
region.

Making use of these \TFs, predictions of background counts from \SM
processes, $\npre^{\rm signal}$, can then be made made based on the
various control samples:
\begin{equation}
  \label{equ:pred-method}
  \npre^{\rm signal}(\njet,\nb,\scalht) = \frac{N_{\rm MC}^{\rm
      signal}(\njet,\nb,\scalht)}{N_{\rm MC}^{\rm
      control}(\njet,\nb,\scalht)} \times \nobs^{\rm
    control}(\njet,\nb,\scalht),
\end{equation}
where $\nobs^{\rm control}$ is the number of events that are observed
within the bin of a control region.

When constructing the \TFs, the \MC expectations for the following \SM
processes are considered: W + jets ($N_{\rm W}$), \ttbar + jets
($N_{\ttbar}$), \znunu\ + jets ($N_{\znunu}$), DY + jets ($N_{\mathrm
DY}$), \gj ($N_\gamma$), single top + jets production via the $s$,
$t$, and $tW$-channels ($N_{\rm top}$), $WW+$~jets, $WZ~+$~jets, and
$ZZ + \textrm{jets}$ ($N_{\rm di-boson}$), and $\ttbar$V or $\ttbar$H
($N_{\rm {\ttbar}X}$). 

The \TFs account for differences in cross sections, acceptance,
reconstruction efficiencies and kinematic requirements between the
signal and control regions. One big advantage of using \TFs is that
any mismodelling effects that are consistent within a particular bin
across relevant \MC samples will cancel out. It is seen that the
mismodelling of hadronic effects typically vary as a function of \HT
and \nj. An example of this mismodelling is visible in Fig.~\ref{} for
example (FIXME refer back to one of the characterisation plots, or put
the plots here? a la mark). The fact that the control samples are
binned within these variables helps to negate this issue, which is
cancelled out within the \TF in each bin.

Many systematic problems within the simulation are expected to mostly
cancel in each \TF. However, a systematic uncertainty is assigned to
each transfer factor to account for theoretical uncertainties and
other mismodelling effects, such as in the acceptances and
reconstruction efficiencies. Details of the specific systematic
uncertainties are given in Sec.~\ref{sec:systematics}.

\subsection{The likelihood model}  % day 3

In the end, a fitting procedure that provides the final result is
defined formally by the likelihood model described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:likelihood}. In summary, the observation in each bin
(defined in terms of the variables \njet, \nb, and \scalht) of the
signal sample is modelled as Poisson-distributed about the sum of a SM
expectation (and a potential signal contribution). The components of
this SM expectation are related to the expected yields in the control
samples via transfer factors derived from simulation. The observations
in each bin (again defined by \njet, \nb, and \scalht) of the control
samples are similarly modelled as Poisson-distributed about the
expected yields for each control sample. In this way, for a given
bin, the observed yields in the signal and control samples are
connected via the transfer factors derived from simulation.
