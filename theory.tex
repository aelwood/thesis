\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}
\label{sec:sm}

%andrew's thesis looks quite brief and concise
The \acf{SM} describes the interaction of matter through the
electromagnetic, weak nuclear and strong forces in the context of a
renormalisable quantum field theory
\cite{Salam:1964ry,Glashow:1961tr,PhysRevLett.19.1264}. The matter
particles are represented as spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermionic fields and
forces are represented as spin-1 bosonic fields. An additional spin-0
\emph{Higgs} field is included to provide the bosons of the weak force
with their mass. A key principle in the \SM is that of local gauge
invariance. The gauge group of the \SM is $SU(3)\times SU(2) \times
U(1)$, when these symmetries are applied to the matter particles they
imply the presence of the force carrying bosons. How this leads to the
particle phenomenology of the \SM will be briefly explored in this
section.

The \SM is typically considered within a lagrangian formalsim. In a
quantum field theory all the the relevant fields and their
interactions are described by a lagrangian density. The lagrangian
density of the \SM can be divided into four parts, which will each be
addressed within this section:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{SM}=\mathcal{L}_{gauge}+\mathcal{L}_{fermion}+\mathcal{L}_{Higgs}+\mathcal{L}_{Yukawa}.
\end{equation}

Throughout this section the convention $c=\hbar = 1$ is used and the
Einstein four-vector summation convention is assumed. Four-vector indices
are labelled as $\mu$ and $\nu$.

\subsection{The fundamental particles}

The fundamental particles of the \SM comprise
fermions and the force mediating bosons, a summary them and their
relevant charges can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:smParticles}. 

The fermions consist of three generations of charged leptons and their
corresponding weak force partner, the neutrinos. There are
additionally three generations of up-quarks and down-quarks. For all
of these twelve fermions there are corresponding antiparticles that
have the same mass but opposite quantum numbers. As fermions are
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles they are described by the Dirac equation
\cite{Griffiths:111880}:
\begin{equation}
(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\psi=0,
\end{equation}
where $\gamma^{\mu}$ are the Dirac matrices, defined by their
anti-commutation relation:
\begin{equation}
\{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma^{\nu}\}=\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}+\gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\mu}=2g^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $g^{\mu\nu}$ is the Minkowski metric. The covariant derivative is denoted
by $\partial_{\mu}$ and $m$ is the mass of the particle in question.

There are five types of bosons that arise from the \SM gauge
symmetries: photons, gluons, $W^{\pm}$, $Z^0$ and the Higgs. Their
properties will be discussed further in this section.

\subsection{Gauge symmetries}

The insensitivity to the structure of a theory to a specific
transformation constitutes a symmetry. This concept is very powerful
for gaining insights into fundamental physical theories. For example,
the fact that physical laws do not change over time, time
translational symmetry, leads to the conservation of energy.  In
general, any symmetries have a corresponding conserved quantity, as
laid out in Noether's theorem \cite{1971TTSP....1..186N}. This concept
is used extensively when formulating the \SM and allows for the
derivation of observed interactions through the imposition of a few,
fairly straightforward, symmetries.

The effect of applying a symmetry within the \SM is demonstrated when
imposing local $U(1)$ invariance on the Dirac lagrangian for a
fermion, with wave function $\psi$ and mass, $m$ \cite{Griffiths:111880}:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}=i\bar{\psi}\cancel{\partial}\psi-m\bar{\psi}\psi.
\end{equation}
A global $U(1)$ transformation, $\psi\rightarrow \exp{i\theta}\psi$,
leaves the lagrangian invariant. If this $U(1)$ transformation is
local, i.e. the phase depends on spacetime position, $x$, then the
lagrangian is no longer invariant. It now transforms as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:uninvariance}
\mathcal{L}\rightarrow\mathcal{L}-q(\partial_{\mu}\theta(x))\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi.
\end{equation}
However, one can add a vector field, $A_{\mu}$, that interacts with
the fermion field through the lagrangian term:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{int}=q(\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi) A_{\mu},
\end{equation}
This vector field is chosen to transform as $A_{\mu}\rightarrow
A_{\mu}+\partial_{\mu}\theta$ and is known as a \emph{gauge field} or
\emph{gauge boson}. The interaction lagrangian term then transforms
under a local gauge transformation as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{int}\rightarrow \mathcal{L}_{int}+q(\partial_{\mu}\theta)\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi,
\end{equation}
this cancels out the term that violated local gauge invariance in
Equation~\ref{eq:uninvariance}. The existence of a new gauge field
allows the addition of an additional gauge invariant term containing
the field strength tensor of the vector field, $F_{\mu\nu}$, which can
be written in general as:
\begin{equation}
F_{\mu\nu}^a=\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}^a-\partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}^a+gf_{abc}A_{\mu}^{b}A_{\nu}^{c},
\end{equation}
for a general gauge group with the structure constants $f^{abc}$. For
the $U(1)$ group there is only one self-commuting generator so the
structure constant is 0. For non-Abelian gauge groups, such as
$SU(3)$, the structure constants can be non-zero, which introduces
self interaction terms within the lagrangian. In this case the gauge
boson will carry a charge and can interact with itself.

The final lagrangian for a Dirac fermion can then be written as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:localdiraclagrangian}
  \mathcal{L}=i\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\mathcal{D}_{\mu}\psi-m\bar{\psi}\psi-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{D}_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}+iqA_{\mu}$ and is known as the
\emph{covariant derivative}. This lagrangian will be invariant under
local $U(1)$ transformations. In this case, the addition of one extra
gauge field maintains local invariance as $U(1)$ transformations have
one degree of freedom, corresponding to a generator of the group.
The local gauge invariance of symmetries with more degrees of freedom
require the addition of one gauge boson per degree of freedom. 

The general principle of obtaining local gauge invariance method
through gauge bosons is applied with great success to the gauge group
of the \SM. With the choice of an appropriate gauge group the bosons
that describe the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces can all be
obtained.

\subsection{Signatures of supersymmetry at the \LHC}

As the \LHC is a hadron collider, the highest cross section SUSY
production processes occur via the strong force
\cite{Martin:1997ns}
\cite{SUSYxsections_NewAspectsof_pp_collisions}. These processes
result in the production of squarks and gluinos, the SUSY particles
with colour charge. In all favoured SUSY models, these relatively
heavy particles decay within the detector to a weakly interacting \LSP,
usually a neutralino \cite{Farrar:1978xj}. In
collisions at the \LHC this will appear as several hard jets with
unbalanced momentum (missing energy).
