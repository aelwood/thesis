\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}
\label{sec:sm}

%technical introduction: is a renormalisable qft

%andrew's thesis looks quite brief and concise

\subsection{The fundamental forces and particles}

%fundamental particles, leptons and photons and the charges they carry
% show a table of the particles

%technical again SU2 ..... where the components are
% which forces these lead to

%ewk unification etc.

%put a bit about jet phenomenology from a QCD point of view

%%%%%%%%% LEAVING THESE OUT FOR NOW %%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Gauge symmetries}
%specific example of gauge symmetries put here by Mark and Robyn
%\subsection{Electroweak unification}
%only need this section if i put gauge symmetries
%prefer to leave these out and be more technical and concise

\subsection{The Higgs mechanism}

\subsection{Beyond the Standard Model}

% all of SM verified so far, everything found, (requires some
% modifications for neutrino masses)
% but there are bigger problems:

%hierarchy problem

%DM
% show the bullet cluster?

%GUT

\section{Supersymmetry}
\label{sec:susy}

%fundamental spacetime symmetry

% as in Mark's and in primer

%solves above problems

\subsection{The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)}

\subsection{Signatures of supersymmetry at the \LHC}

As the \LHC is a hadron collider, the highest cross section SUSY
production processes occur via the strong force
\cite{Martin:1997ns}
\cite{SUSYxsections_NewAspectsof_pp_collisions}. These processes
result in the production of squarks and gluinos, the SUSY particles
with colour charge. In all favoured SUSY models, these relatively
heavy particles decay within the detector to a weakly interacting \LSP,
usually a neutralino \cite{Farrar:1978xj}. In
collisions at the \LHC this will appear as several hard jets with
unbalanced momentum (missing energy). 

\subsection{Simplified models}

%Decays etc.
