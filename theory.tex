\section{Signatures of supersymmetry at the \LHC}

As the \LHC is a hadron collider, the highest cross section SUSY
production processes occur via the strong force
\cite{Martin:1997ns}
\cite{SUSYxsections_NewAspectsof_pp_collisions}. These processes
result in the production of squarks and gluinos, the SUSY particles
with colour charge. In all favoured SUSY models, these relatively
heavy particles decay within the detector to a weakly interacting \LSP,
usually a neutralino \cite{Farrar:1978xj}. In
collisions at the \LHC this will appear as several hard jets with
unbalanced momentum (missing energy).
