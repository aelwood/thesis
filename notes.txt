  TODO:
    - \ Add references for dark matter and dark energy in Intro and in
      other places!
    - \ Sort out the references in general
    - \ Add the emulator stuff before conclusion of trigger chapter
    - \ consider the btag track statement? think it's fair...

    - \ Check the weak isospin stuff
    - \ Sort out the signs in the higgs potential!

    - \ Add references to old alphaT searches?

    - Make sure the cut values for the correct iteration of the
      analysis are chosen
        - \ put in alphat cut for photons if doing ICHEP
        - \ make sure the HT bins are correct
        - \ make sure the TF and likelihood description is correct
          - \ Get the bit about the number of rate parameters right

    - Add plots to the event selection section
    - \ put in the Btag formula method or not? - not
    - check the ICHEP approval talk for plots?

    - Go through the systematics section again

    more attention to:
      - systematics!
      - QCD bit dphi vs bdphi
      - rest of bkgd prediction
      - reread results


    Optional extras to add:
      - minChi optimisation
      - new working point scans?
      - stuff on variable optimisation
      - qcd breakdown from Xtian




STUFF TO REMEMBER I DID:
  - other optimisation (maybe remake? see my talks)
  - \ dPhi vs bDPhi plots (see ICHEP NOTE)
  - QCD method
  - MinChi studies? should i put this here? - probably not but it's
    possible

  to emphasise:
    - optimisation?
    - closure tests
    - variations for systs (e.g. nisr etc)



POTENTIAL VIVA QUESTIONS/REVISION:

- Know the resolutions for the tracker, ECAL, HCAL and pT dependence
  etc.
    - for ECAL pT resolution is better than tracker at 15GeV
    - for HCAL few 100s of GeV before this is true
    - This is important to know WRT start of PFlow section

- Revise: multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, ionisation
    - i.e. what is a MIP, how it all works

- Decays of backgrounds
    - what proportion of Z's decay to nus etc...

- Composition of jets

- Be able to derive the gauge invariance stuff, like in Robyn and Mark's
  theses

- Properly explain the hierarchy problem (ie in SUSY primer)

- Make myself clear on what's going on with charges in the SM group
  theory (ie end of gauge group section)

- Difference between chirality and helicity and how that's manifest in
  the EWK stuff

- how does one choose a specific gauge for the higgs stuff! (see
robyn's thesis)

- how to add nu mass to the SM (for morgan...)

- Why do you have to mix the gauge fields to get the physical fields?

- Make sure I can show how the multijet alphaT comes from the dijet
  version

- Work out alphaT formula show I can show it's MET equivalent

- Revise basic relativity, what is a transverse mass etc.

- understand how beam halo effects arise 

- read asymptotic paper from Glen Cowan

- make sure to understand the lost lepton stuff for the systematic

- explain why W polarisation effects may be a thing

- describe a linear orthogonal polynomial

- make sure i can describe the subtleties of the fit, ie difference
  between CR only and SR only fit and why the pulls change

- which systematics are pulled in each of the cases

- the ISR correction covers pdf uncertainties

- explain where the excesses in T1tttt come from etc.

- remember about the blank region of T2tt - difference in MET
  modelling between fast and full sim, there is no MET here due to
  decaying directly to a top
