  TODO:
    - Add references for dark matter and dark energy in Intro and in
      other places!
    - Sort out the references in general
    - Add the emulator stuff before conclusion of trigger chapter

    -consider the btag track statement? think it's fair...

STUFF TO REMEMBER I DID:
  - other optimisation (maybe remake? see my talks)
  - dPhi vs bDPhi plots (see ICHEP NOTE)
  - QCD method
  - MinChi studies? should i put this here?



POTENTIAL VIVA QUESTIONS/REVISION:

- Know the resolutions for the tracker, ECAL, HCAL and pT dependence
  etc.
    - for ECAL pT resolution is better than tracker at 15GeV
    - for HCAL few 100s of GeV before this is true
    - This is important to know WRT start of PFlow section

- Revise: multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, ionisation
    - i.e. what is a MIP, how it all works

- Decays of backgrounds
    - what proportion of Z's decay to nus etc...

- Composition of jets
