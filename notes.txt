  TODO:
    - \ Add references for dark matter and dark energy in Intro and in
      other places!
    - \ Sort out the references in general
    - \ Add the emulator stuff before conclusion of trigger chapter
    - \ consider the btag track statement? think it's fair...

    - \ Check the weak isospin stuff
    - \ Sort out the signs in the higgs potential!

    - \ Add references to old alphaT searches?

    ******
    - Make sure the cut values for the correct iteration of the
      analysis are chosen
        - put in alphat cut for photons if doing ICHEP
        - make sure the HT bins are correct
        - make sure the TF and likelihood description is correct
          - Get the bit about the number of rate parameters right
    ******

    - Add plots to the event selection section
    - put in the Btag formula method or not?


STUFF TO REMEMBER I DID:
  - other optimisation (maybe remake? see my talks)
  - dPhi vs bDPhi plots (see ICHEP NOTE)
  - QCD method
  - MinChi studies? should i put this here?

  to emphasise:
    - optimisation?
    - closure tests
    - variations for systs (e.g. nisr etc)



POTENTIAL VIVA QUESTIONS/REVISION:

- Know the resolutions for the tracker, ECAL, HCAL and pT dependence
  etc.
    - for ECAL pT resolution is better than tracker at 15GeV
    - for HCAL few 100s of GeV before this is true
    - This is important to know WRT start of PFlow section

- Revise: multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung, ionisation
    - i.e. what is a MIP, how it all works

- Decays of backgrounds
    - what proportion of Z's decay to nus etc...

- Composition of jets

- Be able to derive the gauge invariance stuff, like in Robyn and Mark's
  theses

- Properly explain the hierarchy problem (ie in SUSY primer)

- Make myself clear on what's going on with charges in the SM group
  theory (ie end of gauge group section)

- Difference between chirality and helicity and how that's manifest in
  the EWK stuff

- how does one choose a specific gauge for the higgs stuff! (see
robyn's thesis)

- how to add nu mass to the SM (for morgan...)

- Why do you have to mix the gauge fields to get the physical fields?

- Make sure I can show how the multijet alphaT comes from the dijet
  version

- Work out alphaT formula show I can show it's MET equivalent

- Revise basic relativity, what is a transverse mass etc.

- understand how beam halo effects arise 

- read asymptotic paper from Glen Cowan
