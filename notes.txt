  TODO:
    - Add references for dark matter and dark energy in Intro and in
      other places!
    - Sort out the references in general

STUFF TO REMEMBER I DID:
  - other optimisation (maybe remake? see my talks)
  - dPhi vs bDPhi plots (see ICHEP NOTE)
  - QCD method
  - MinChi studies? should i put this here?
