Modern physics has now reached a point in which our fundamental
understanding can be broken down into two separate arenas. At large
length scales, where gravity is dominant, the theory of \GR is
incredibly successful in reproducing experimental observations.
However, to provide a description of the subatomic constituents of
matter and the three other fundamental forces we rely on a quantum
field theory, the \SM of particle physics. However, at very high
energy densities, where both theories are relevant, our understanding
breaks down. The main aim of fundamental physics research is therefore
the reconcilation of quantum field theory with general relativity. 

One way to approach this is to explore the energy scales after the
\SM, but before \GR becomes relevant. To these ends a giant proton
synchrotron, the \LHC, was built at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland. The
\LHC is designed to smash protons together at record breaking
energies. Around these collision points are built various detectors
that explore the results of these high energy collisions. One of the
two general purpose detectors designed for searching for a wide range
of phenomena is the \CMS detector. With the \LHC and \CMS detector as
tools, it is the exploration of the new energies beyond the \SM that
is the subject of this thesis.

The \SM is one of the most successful scientific theories to date
\cite{Salam:1964ry,Glashow:1961tr,PhysRevLett.19.1264}. It makes
predictions about the physical world that have consistently stood up
to experimental scrutiny, culminating in the discovery of a $125$\gev
particle consistent with a Higgs boson at the \LHC in
2012~\cite{1207.7214,1207.7235}.  Despite its successes, the \SM does
not provide a description for two significant experimental anomalies.
From astronomical observations, it can be inferred that \SM particles
cannot solely account for the total gravitational behaviour of various
objects in the universe. This anomaly can be explained by introducing
a new form of weakly interacting particle, known as ``\DM''. On top of
this it is observed that the rate of the expansion of the universe is
increasing, implying the existence of ``dark energy''. A rough
calculation of the scale of dark energy predicted by the \SM yields a
result that is many of order of magnitude different from the observed
value. This implies a signicant lack of understanding of the origin of
this phenomena.  Additionally, fine tuning problems are present within
the \SM itself.  Along with the irreconcilability of the \SM with \GR,
these issues point towards the existence of a more fundamental theory
of nature that goes beyond the \SM. 

One popular way to extend the \SM is to introduce a new broken
spacetime symmetry between fermions and bosons, known as
\SUSY. Initially motivated by purely mathematical arguments, \SUSY
models can provide a candidate for dark matter, solve the Higgs
hierarchy problem and also unify the strong, weak and electromagnetic
forces at the ``GUT'' scale, which is not possible in the \SM. To
convincingly solve these problems, \SUSY is expected to exhibit itself
close to the electroweak scale of the \SM. If this is the case, there
is a significant chance that supersymmetric particles will be produced
at the \LHC. This will be further explained in
Chapter~\ref{chap:theory}.

%In Run~1 the \LHC delivered $19.7~\ifb$ of collision data at an
In Run~1 the \LHC delivered a large dataset at $7$ and $8~\tev$ centre
of mass energies. The analysis of these data, however, has not
resulted in any observation of \SUSY production. With Run~2 of the
\LHC, that began in 2015, the collision energy has been significantly
increased to 13\tev. The data taken in this new run therefore hold the
best chance yet for the discovery of electroweak scale \SUSY.

This thesis will present the details and results of a search
for \SUSY in Run~2 data collected by the \CMS detector at the \LHC.
The analysis presented looks for \SUSY signatures in a final state
with hadronic jets and missing transverse momentum. The results of
this search are interpreted in a series of simplified \SUSY and \DM
models.
