Hi Adam and Morgan,

   Here's my list of minor corrections to Adam's thesis, including also a couple of things that came up in the viva. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense.

      Again, congratulations and best wishes for the future ...

      Paul

      \ 4) force partner -> force partners

      \ 6) Full stop after eq 2.6

      8) Please look again at the description of fragmentation and hadronisation (when are there quarks and when hadrons?)

      \ 9) Hyphenate inter-generational

      \ 11) comma after Goldstone bosons

      \ 12) points to -> point to

      Section 4.5) Please consider adding a sprinkling of plots (or else clear citations) summarising the jet performance in terms of JES uncertainty etc

      \ 34) drop > before 99% (in fact you can probably write 99.9%)?

      \ 39) cannot not ... Freudian slip? :-)

      \ 55) works works

      56) y axis label has mean rather than median (don't worry if you're unable to change that)

      \ 56) take the energy -> takes the energy

      57) Fig 5.7 confused us in the viva. - Check what's plotted?...

      \57) Fig 5.7 figure x axis is <DeltaR^2>, caption is just R

      58) same comment as page 56 on axis label

      \ 63) Suggest to add PU=140 in caption of fig 5.13

      \ 88) I was confused by 'undefined with 40 GeV jets' ... should it be 'with <40 GeV jets'?

      \ 90) background that pass -> background that passes

      \ 91) events are a categorised

      94) Some quantification of the reweight and scale factors would be good in terms of plots or citations.

      119) Is it possible to say what the most important systematics are in terms of restrictions on the sensitivity / limits?... and to quantify how much effect the systematics have on the limits at all?

      \ 119) 1st line of table caption, representatives -> representative

      120) Could you indicate how the systematics are included in the likelihoods?

      \ 132) commissioned is currently

      \ 133) sort of generic -> sorts of generic


Double check or do:


      \\ 8) Please look again at the description of fragmentation and hadronisation (when are there quarks and when hadrons?)

      \\ Section 4.5) Please consider adding a sprinkling of plots (or else clear citations) summarising the jet performance in terms of JES uncertainty etc
        \ - Quantify the jet resolution
        \ - cite CMS jet performance

      \\ 56) y axis label has mean rather than median (don't worry if you're unable to change that)

      \\ 57) Fig 5.7 confused us in the viva. - Check what's plotted?...

      \\ 58) same comment as page 56 on axis label

      \\ 66) Figure numbers in text go wrong: 5.19a -> 5.16a and 5.18a -> 5.16a

      \\ 94) Some quantification of the reweight and scale factors would be good in terms of plots or citations.
        \ - Put in the PU RW plot
        \ - Find a reference for the scale factor stuff + say they're O few percent
          \ - add muon
          \ - add btag stuff

      \\ 119) Is it possible to say what the most important systematics are in terms of restrictions on the sensitivity / limits?... and to quantify how much effect the systematics have on the limits at all?
        \ - check if there have been any studies, speak to Matt etc.
        \ - put a paragraph in the exclusion limits section

      \\ 120) Could you indicate how the systematics are included in the likelihoods?
        \ - figure out something based on matts thing
          \ - put in Matt's equation
          \ - make sure it's EPE (one a)
