Hi Adam and Morgan,

   Here's my list of minor corrections to Adam's thesis, including also a couple of things that came up in the viva. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense.

      Again, congratulations and best wishes for the future ...

      Paul

      \ 3) the the

      \ 4) force partner -> force partners

      \ 6) Full stop after eq 2.6

      8) Please look again at the description of fragmentation and hadronisation (when are there quarks and when hadrons?)

      \ 9) Hyphenate inter-generational

      \ 11) comma after Goldstone bosons

      \ 12) points to -> point to

      \ 14) versions of supersymmetry is     (-> are)

      Section 4.5) Please consider adding a sprinkling of plots (or else clear citations) summarising the jet performance in terms of JES uncertainty etc

      \ 34) drop > before 99% (in fact you can probably write 99.9%)?

      \ 39) cannot not ... Freudian slip? :-)

      \ 41) often indicate -> often indicates

      \ 44) |eta| < 5    ->    |eta| = 5

      \ 54) Bullets 1 and 3, inverse -> negative

      \ 55) this criteria -> this criterion

      \ 55) This predominantly -> This is predominantly

      \ 55) works works

      56) y axis label has mean rather than median (don't worry if you're unable to change that)

      \ 56) take the energy -> takes the energy

      57) Fig 5.7 confused us in the viva. - Check what's plotted?...

      \57) Fig 5.7 figure x axis is <DeltaR^2>, caption is just R

      58) same comment as page 56 on axis label

      \ 63) Suggest to add PU=140 in caption of fig 5.13

      \ 66) Figure numbers in text go wrong: 5.19a -> 5.16a and 5.18a -> 5.16a

      \ 67) Same problem, 5.18 -> 5.17, 5.19a -> 5.17

      \ 67) threshold is plotted -> thrshold are plotted

      \ 72) that or uninstrumented

      \ 88) I was confused by 'undefined with 40 GeV jets' ... should it be 'with <40 GeV jets'?

      \ 90) background that pass -> background that passes

      \ 91) events are a categorised

      94) Some quantification of the reweight and scale factors would be good in terms of plots or citations.

      \ 94) number of PU collisions is -> number ... are

      119) Is it possible to say what the most important systematics are in terms of restrictions on the sensitivity / limits?... and to quantify how much effect the systematics have on the limits at all?

      \ 119) 1st line of table caption, representatives -> representative

      120) Could you indicate how the systematics are included in the likelihoods?

      \ 132) commissioned is currently

      \ 133) sort of generic -> sorts of generic


Double check or do:


      \ 8) Please look again at the description of fragmentation and hadronisation (when are there quarks and when hadrons?)

      \ Section 4.5) Please consider adding a sprinkling of plots (or else clear citations) summarising the jet performance in terms of JES uncertainty etc
        \ - Quantify the jet resolution
        \ - cite CMS jet performance

      \ 56) y axis label has mean rather than median (don't worry if you're unable to change that)

      \ 57) Fig 5.7 confused us in the viva. - Check what's plotted?...

      \ 58) same comment as page 56 on axis label

      \ 66) Figure numbers in text go wrong: 5.19a -> 5.16a and 5.18a -> 5.16a

      \ 67) Same problem, 5.18 -> 5.17, 5.19a -> 5.17

      \ 94) Some quantification of the reweight and scale factors would be good in terms of plots or citations.
        \ - Put in the PU RW plot
        \ - Find a reference for the scale factor stuff + say they're O few percent
          \ - add muon
          \ - add btag stuff

      \ 119) Is it possible to say what the most important systematics are in terms of restrictions on the sensitivity / limits?... and to quantify how much effect the systematics have on the limits at all?
        \ - check if there have been any studies, speak to Matt etc.
        \ - put a paragraph in the exclusion limits section

      \ 120) Could you indicate how the systematics are included in the likelihoods?
        \ - figure out something based on matts thing
          \ - put in Matt's equation
          \ - make sure it's EPE (one a)
